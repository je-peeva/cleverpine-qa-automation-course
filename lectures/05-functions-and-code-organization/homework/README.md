### 2. Expected Output

The program will output the following sections to the console:
Basic Metrics: Displays overall test statistics, including total tests, number of passed tests, and the calculated success rate.
Failures: Lists the names of tests that did not pass for quick identification of problem cases.
Formatted Times: Shows each test’s execution time in a readable format and prints the average duration across all tests.
Email Validation (Sample): Demonstrates email validation logic by checking and labeling sample addresses as valid or invalid.
