**Common Testing Patterns:**

Study these real-world patterns for inspiration:
- Form validation logic
- API response checking
- Dynamic test data generation
- Environment-specific test configuration

**Next Lecture Preview:**
In Lecture 3, we'll learn about Arrays and Loops - essential tools for handling multiple test data sets, iterating through test results, and processing lists of elements that we'll encounter in Playwright testing. We'll build on today's conditional logic to make decisions while processing collections of data.
