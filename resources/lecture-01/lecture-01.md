**Assignment for Next Lecture:**

1. Complete the hands-on exercise if not finished in class
2. Create three more test scenario functions using different data types
3. Practice using console.log with various messages
4. Read MDN JavaScript Basics (variables and data types sections)
5. Come prepared with questions about any setup issues you encountered

**Next Lecture Preview:**
In Lecture 2, we'll dive deeper into JavaScript fundamentals specifically for testing: working with strings and numbers, using operators to make comparisons, and implementing decision-making logic with if/else statements. We'll build on today's foundation to create more sophisticated test logic.
